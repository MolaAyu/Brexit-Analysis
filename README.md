# Brexit-Analysis
# Political stance classification
In this project, we will solve a supervised machine learning task. The data that we will use for training and evaluation will be annotated collectively by us and other individuals.
The machine learning task that will be addressed in this project is to develop a text classifier that determines whether a given textual comment expresses an opinion that is positive or negative towards Brexit: the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.
The first two parts of this project deal with data annotation and are solved individually. In the third and final part, you will implement the classification system, and here you will work in a group of two or three people.
Didactic purpose of this assignment:
* Getting some practical understanding of annotating data and inter-annotator agreement.
* Practice several aspects of system development based on machine learning: getting data, cleaning data, processing and selecting features, selecting and tuning a model, evaluating.
* Analyzing results in a machine learning experiment.
